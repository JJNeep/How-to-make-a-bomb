    <h1>How to Make a Bomb</h1>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Locate any highly combustible or reactive substances in the household.</li>
        <li>Create detonators and fuses to help with the KABOOM part of the bomb.</li>
        <li>If the bomb you are making is nuclear, you will need to set up specialized detonators to drive a nuclear substance of your choice into a larger clump of the same nuclear substance. This heavy collision will trigger a nuclear meltdown and explode.</li>
        <li>Make sure that your detonators are fully set up and have a fuse ready to connect to a Remote Detonation Device (RDD).</li>
        <li>Get to a safe distance, if the bomb is nuclear (100 - 500km), and when ready click the button and enjoy a bomb!</li>
    </ol>
